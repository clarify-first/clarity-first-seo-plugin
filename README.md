# Clarity First SEO (Beta)

Clarity First SEO is a **facts-first** WordPress SEO plugin focused on **clear signals** (titles, descriptions, canonicals, robots, schema) and **readable diagnostics**. It's built for site owners and teams who want to **see what search engines can read**—without "magic" promises.

> **Beta note:** This is an early release. UI and behaviors may change between versions.

---

## What this plugin does

### Core SEO signals
- Custom SEO titles & meta descriptions (with safe fallbacks)
- Canonical URL output
- Robots meta defaults + per-content overrides
- Open Graph / Twitter tags (social previews)
- JSON‑LD schema output (Organization / WebSite / WebPage, etc.)

### Diagnostics & validation (facts-based)
- **Site Diagnostics:** site-wide checks (sitemap discovery, duplicate signals, indexing blocks, canonical consistency, redirect patterns)
- **Page Diagnostics:** inspect a single URL and see the exact tags/headers/redirects present
- **Robots.txt tools:** view and manage crawl rules safely
- **Bulk Edit:** update SEO fields & indexing rules across many posts/pages

### IndexNow (optional)
- If enabled, the plugin can notify **IndexNow participating search engines** when URLs change.

✅ **No rank guarantees. No “instant #1” claims.** Just clear output and checks.

---

## External requests & privacy

- **No tracking / telemetry** is sent to Clarity‑First SEO servers.
- **External network calls happen only when you enable or trigger them**, for example:
  - **IndexNow submissions** (to the IndexNow endpoint) when IndexNow is enabled.
  - Optional **user‑initiated** connectivity tests you run inside the plugin UI.
- Diagnostics generally fetch **your own site URLs** to inspect output.

If you ship to the WordPress Plugin Directory, make sure your WP.org `readme.txt` clearly discloses any external requests.
